Computer Information Science-Programming 300 2014 Prof. Chapman

***This repository is primarily for students who are enrolled in Spring 2014 in CISP300 at CRC.  Everyone is welcome to post their questions, concerns, and problems. I can maybe write certain problems from Chapter 2-Chapter 12 that might benifit us all. I believe the discussion board can get a little disorganized and its best categorizing ceratin topics instead throwing every question into the board.***

***Please try not to post any answers for the HW before the deadline, it will violate one of the policies from the Syllabus and it may or most likely lead to a serious offense. If I do encounter any informaiton that may relate to copying i'll delete it.  The purpose of this is to get acquainted with GitHub and help eachother in an informal way.***
