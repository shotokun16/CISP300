CISP300 
=======

Computer Information Science-Programming 300 2014 Prof. Chapman

***This repository is primarily for students who are enrolled in Spring 2014 in CISP300 at CRC.  Everyone is welcome to post their questions, concerns, and problems. I can maybe write certain problems from Chapter 2-Chapter 12 that will benifit us all (getting preped before quizzes, midterm, and final). I believe the discussion board can get a little disorganized and its best categorizing ceratin topics instead throwing every question into the board.***

***Please try not to post any answers for the HW before the deadline, it will violate one of the policies from the Syllabus and it may or most likely lead to a serious offense (since this repo is public). If I do encounter any information that may relate to copying/cheating i'll immediately delete it.  The purpose of this is to get acquainted with GitHub and help eachother in a constructive way.***



Note: This is my first time organizing a GitHub repo, so please feel free to give me any suggestions to improve or modify this repo.
